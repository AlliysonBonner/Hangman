Hangman is a word guessing game where you must guess the letters of a secret word. Each incorrect guess results in the drawing of a new part of a gallows and a person hanging from it, line by line. The game is over when the word is guessed correctly or the person is fully drawn.

## Usage
1. Run the game by running python hangman.py in your terminal or command prompt.
1. Enter your guess for a letter when prompted, and press enter.
1. The game will continue until the word is guessed correctly or the person is fully drawn.
